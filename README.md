# Calendar App

Hello, welcome to the calendar app project.

## This project allows:

1 - Add Reminders on espcific Date / Time and City. Obs: The reminder text can only have 30 characters maximum.

1.1 - When you put the city on reminders register form, it shows to you the weather forecast for day and city.
    Obs: To setup this integration, you will need to put on .env file the Weather Forecast Api URL and KEY.

    REACT_APP_API_WEATHER_URL=https://weather.visualcrossing.com/VisualCrossingWebServices/rest/services/timeline

    The key, you have to create one for yourself, or feel free to use mine: 
    REACT_APP_API_WEATHER_KEY= MPWDWU6Y5WZLBCX2A9FWDEPHC

2 - Update reminders.

3 - Alert from reminders on date / hour setted.
